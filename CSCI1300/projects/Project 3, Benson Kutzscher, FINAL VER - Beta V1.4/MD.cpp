//When you compile type in the console:"g++ -std=c++11 MD.cpp Player.cpp Map.cpp Zombie.cpp Item.cpp Weapon.cpp"

main driver:
    loops through the play fucnion while the player is still playing,
     becuase if they die they can be prompted to play again





//play functions gets the user playing
//note that in order to make this work, many more helper functions will be created
play()

    ////    before we start the game update loop, get the player set up     ////
    //like idk set players health to zero n shit


    ////    "game update loop"    ////
    //while our player is still playing, continue updating the game and looping through
    //each turn is 1 time going through this loop
    while loop{


        ////first display current stats and things

        ////second get the players response for the current turn they are on
        
        ////then take their input and call some kind of things to make what they wanted to do actually happen in game


        ////call some kind of updateAllThings() funcion that updates everything going on
        ////like, it'll move the zombies for example


        ////check if there is a condition to end the game
        ////    if they died or they got 3 keys then break the loops below:

        //if player dies..... or the player wins with 3 keys.....
        
        //stop the loop with them playing the round
        
        //then ask if they want to play again
        
        
        

        //this is what we will return to our main funcion where this function was called
        //if they say they want to play again, then this variable will get returned, causing this fucnion to restart

//CURRENT UPDATE:

//Changed the include statements to not have the .cpp files just because the TA in recitation told us it was bad practice and you could easily define objects too many times. 
//So only the header files are included now, 
//When you compile type in the console:"g++ -std=c++11 MD.cpp Player.cpp Map.cpp Zombie.cpp Item.cpp Weapon.cpp" and it should compile perfectly.


/*
Anywheres changes I made with this round of working were:
* Made it so the chance to get a key goes up slightly every time the player gets a key, since it starts off as a rare chance.
    Did this primarily so the game isn't too long
* I changed the amount of zombies spawning from 15 to 20 because I did a test run and in 63 turns I won and didn't run into a single zombie. I'd rather there be too many than too little zombies
* Also fixed a bug causing a segmentation fault in my inventory array
* Changed a few of your comments to look more presentable for when we upload, 
    but I didn't change many so you can feel free to change the rest of yours to look more presentable to the TAs, 
    I still need to add comments to the CPP files I made but I'll do that around when we're 100% finished
*Made some minor touch ups to the stats displayed every turn, mainly so they look more symetrical and also added the words end of turn at the bar that is displayed
* I removed the run option from the battle function because the player doesn't move on the map after they run, and even if we made it so, it'd be really easy for the player to immediately run into another zombie. 
    So since it's not a requirement, I just removed it all together. Rest of the battle function is as normal
* I believe I fixed a bug that made battles not end immediately when the player hits 0 HP
* Fixed bug in the weapon class that made it so the weapons didn't reload
* Made it so the player can input their name at the start of the round now

Bugs that still need patching:
*Even with 20 zombies, it still feels light fights are rare, are all of them moving? Or do we still need more zombies?

Final update I believe:

added in the .txt files for the score board and sorting algorithem to sort the leaderboards!
