    "In Random vs Random for some reason player 1 wins about 15% of the time and player 2 wins about 75% of the time. This used to output 50/50 but after changing up some code to make minimax run more efficiently (none of which would logically have changed the random function at all...) this function started outputting strainge results. I have debugged this for hours alone and with the help of two different TAs and no one could figure out why this is happening. The random function spits out consistently random moves."

    "### How it works\n",
    "NOTE: I am using these libraries: copy, math, time, random\n",
    "The AI player works on a minimax algorithem with a version of alpha-beta pruning to improve runtime. Lets look through each part of the algorithem step by step to understand how it all works. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before minimax is called, best_move funciton is called. Before that the AI_vs_random_match_analysis funciton is called. I'll start by explaining the outermost fucntion and then we will work our way into the more complex funcitons.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### AI_vs_random_match_analysis function\n",
    "This function runs an entered number of \"games\" (defualt 100) testing an AI player vs a random player. It is essentially a for loop which playes a \"games\" count of games, and counts up the number of times each player wins, and whenever there is a tie. Every time the AI player makes a move, the best_move function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### best_move function\n",
    "This function takes in a gamestate. It then uses the possible_valid_moves function to see what moves are available. On each move, it runs the minimax funciton to get a value of how useful that move is. This means: assuming the oponenet makes the best moves they can, and AI makes the best moves it can, what would be the score at the end of the game, given the AI makes one of the possible moves available. Whichever move causes the best predicted outcome for the AI player the AI will choose as the move it makes. Note that if the AI is player 2 instead of player 1, it will choose the move with the smallest value. This is becuase minimax returns the score in terms of player 1 (player 1 score - player 2 score), so if we are player 2 we want to choose the value which gives player 1 the smallest score at the end of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### minimax function\n",
    "The minimax funciton is a recursive function which alternates between maximizing player 1, and minimazing player 2. This function takes in a game state. It looks at the possible moves available  for either player 1 or 2, and then calls minimax function on each of these moves. Each call of minimax it alternates between players 1 and 2. This causes it to explore every possible move for either player 1 or 2 at each level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually it hits a stopping condition. This is when \"depth\" <= 0 (depth is a value we enter in ahead of time so it doen't go through every mancala game which can ever exist (that value may approach infinity)). OR when the simulated game hits a winning state. When it hits one of these stopping conditons it returns player 1 score - player 2 score, this value is how much player 1 will be winning by at the end of the game. What it finally returns to the best_move function is a value of what the AI would be expected to be winning by if it makes a particular move.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the recursive calls dead end it returns back up through the calls. Each level, either min or max, is trying to minimize or maximize the value returned. Each max level is simulating an ideal move from player 1, where player 1 tries to maximize its score at the end of the game. Each min level is opposite.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also alpha-beta pruning which just makes the algorithm run faster. Here's how it works: If we are minimizing a level, and we have a specific min value, say 4. Then when we call minimax to simulate the next game state, we are maximizing. On this maximizing level we can decide this level is not nesisary to calculate if it has a value to return which is greater than 4. This is becuase when we recurse backwards and we are now minimizing, the value greater than 4 will be discarded. Result: using alpha beta pruning we can prune sections of our recursive function and prevent excess redundant calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What I learned\n",
    "i learned about minimax, how the function works internally, how to implement it with a recursive function. I also learned about alphabeta pruning and how much faster minimax can be with alpha beta pruning implemented. \n"
