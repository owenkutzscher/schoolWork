ABOUT THIS PROJECT
------------------------
This game is a turn based survival game about a player stuck in a labyrinth with a bunch of zombies. The door out of the labyrinth has been locked.
Not to worry however, there are 3 keys hidden in the labyrinth. Once the player finds all 3, he will escape and finish the game.
The primary objective is to use your given weapons to defend yourself from zombies, search for ammo, healing items and keys. Find all 3 keys and escape in as few turns as possible.
