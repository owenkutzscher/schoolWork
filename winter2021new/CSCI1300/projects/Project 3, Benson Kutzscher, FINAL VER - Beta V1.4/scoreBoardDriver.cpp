//// this is some code that I edited, Idk if reece used it on his version, so ill paste it in if his version doesnt have this

//this is to check if the player has won the game
    //if the player has won, slightly different things will occur at the very end

score board driver!!!
 this is just to test out some functions


//now that they've died, lets record their name in the scoreBoard.txt file
//they will be stored in a very specific way so its easy to get the names back, and 
// then display them in order from best to worst. Followed by players who didn't finish the game
////////
//EX: 
//player.getPlayerName() ... "Reeceowen"
//turns ... 27
//written into scoreBoard.txt as: "Reeceown,27"


//soooo

//lets make a function to erase all the leader boards. That can
// be called before the game starts if the scoreBoard.txt file isnt empty by default
    //erase the scoreBoard.txt file

//lets make a function to add names to the leaderboard
    //adds a playerName,numTurns to the scoreBoard.txt file

//lets make a function to read the lederboards,
// we'll make sure to display the names in ranked order
    //adds the player's name to a vector of players names
    //adds the players score to a vector of players scores

    //sorts the vector of scores, anything it swaps in the sores vector, 
    // it also swaps in the same players name so that they stay in synch
    //then after it is done, it prints out the names and their scores in order in some fancy way
