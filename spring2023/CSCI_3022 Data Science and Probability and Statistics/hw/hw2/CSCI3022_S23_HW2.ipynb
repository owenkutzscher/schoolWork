You may discuss questions you have with your classmates or on Piazza or in office hours, but all work you submit must be your own, which means when writing up your solutions or code, you MUST do it entirely by yourself. \n",

    "     - Option1 : Select Kernel->Restart & Run All. Use File ->  Print Preview, and then Right-Click -> Print using your default browser and \"Print to PDF\"\n",
    " \n",
    "     - Option 2: Select Kernel->Restart & Run All. Use File -> Download as PDF via LaTeX.  This will require your system path find a working install of a TeX compiler\n",

    " \n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "- For full points you must correctly match your questions to the respective Gradescope problem, and include clear comments in your code.   Please note that any LaTeX that is not correctly rendered in your submitted PDF will result in a 0 on the entire problem(s) that involves the unrendered LaTeX. \n",
    "- For any question that asks you to calculate something, you **must show all work and justify your answers to receive credit**. Sparse or nonexistent work will receive sparse or nonexistent credit. \n",

    "- LaTeX Tips:  Here is a [reference guide] (https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference).  **All** of your written commentary, justifications and mathematical work should be in Markdown.  I also recommend the [wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX) for LaTex.\n",
    "- Because you can technically evaluate notebook cells is a non-linear order, it's a good idea to do **Kernel $\\rightarrow$ Restart & Run All** as a check before submitting your solutions.  \n",
    "- It is **bad form** to make your reader interpret numerical output from your code.  If a question asks you to compute some value from the data you should show your code output **AND** write a summary of the results in Markdown directly below your code. \n",
    "\n",
    "- There is *not a prescribed API* for these problems.  You may answer coding questions with whatever syntax or object typing you deem fit.  Your evaluation will primarily live in the clarity of how well you present your final results, so don't skip over any interpretations!  Your code should still be commented and readable to ensure you followed the given course algorithm."

I predict this is because the taller people had an easier time seeing the testing stations, and the smarter ones were more likley to be interested and get tested.
