//Map class

//summery
//the map class keeps track of the player's location, keeping their coordinates as variables x and y
//the map class also keeps track of the zombies locations, storing them
//the map class, in general, keeps track of the locations of everything that can be displayed
//at its core it will be creating an "image" of the map that can be printed out
//the map will have dimentions 5x9
//the map's grid will be displayed how it will be printed, from top to bottom and left to right, meaning:
// 0,0 corosponds to the top left, and 0,1 would be the top row, one move to the right





//order of things to get done:
//
//make it so the player can move around within the 5x9 grid, and they can't go outside the boundries of the grid
//
//make it so the player can go to the edge of the displayed map and go into another "chamber"
//      with this make it so the player can't go through walls
//      idea on how to make that work: make a 2D array with 0s and 1s, 0s they can walk through, 1s they cant
//
//add zombies and get their movement and stuff working
//
//add anything else





//pseudo code
/*

data members:

playerX
playerY
zombiesArrRow
zombiesArrCol
zombiesArray, has zombie positions, 2s for no zombies 3s for zombies



member functions:

displayMap
    prints out the current map
    displays where the player is
    if we have to include more things then display those too

    in total the map has a size of 15 rows and 27 columns
    so we will need to display only a section of the map
    do this by checking if the players x and y is within some specified ranges
    and if its inside some specific ranges then we can display the part of the map that corosponds to this ranges
