For our data, we'll use a <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/zhangluyuan/ab-testing?select=ab_data.csv'>dataset from Kaggle</a> (`ab_data.csv`),  which contains the results of an A/B test on what seems to be 2 different designs of a website page (old_page vs. new_page). Here's what we'll do:\n",

    "To make it a bit more realistic, here's a potential **scenario** for our study:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Let's imagine you work on the product team at a medium-sized **online e-commerce business**. The UX designer worked really hard on a new version of the product page, with the hope that it will lead to a higher conversion rate. The product manager (PM) told you that the **current conversion rate** is about **13%** on average throughout the year, and that the team would be happy with an **increase of 2%**, meaning that the new design will be considered a success if it raises the conversion rate to 15%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before rolling out the change, the team would be more comfortable testing it on a small number of users to see how it performs, so you suggest running an **A/B test** on a subset of your user base users.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Designing our experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing the variables\n",
    "\n",
    "For our A/B test we'll need **two groups**:\n",
    "* A `control` group - They'll be shown the old design\n",
    "* A `treatment` (or experimental) group - They'll be shown the new design\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be our *Independent Variable*. The reason we have two groups even though we know the baseline conversion rate is that we want to control for other variables that could have an effect on our results, such as seasonality: by having a `control` group we can directly compare their results to the `treatment` group, because the only systematic difference between the groups is the design of the product page, and we can therefore attribute any differences in results to the designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our *Dependent Variable* (i.e. what we are trying to measure), we are interested in capturing the `conversion rate`. A way we can code this is by  each user session with a binary variable:\n",
    "* `0` - The user did not buy the product during this user session\n",
    "* `1` - The user bought the product during this user session\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, we can easily calculate the mean for each group to get the conversion rate of each design.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1:  Formulating a hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "First things first, we want to make sure we formulate a hypothesis at the start of our project. This will make sure our interpretation of the results is correct as well as rigorous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $p_1$ be the conversion rate in the treatment group (shown the new design) and $p_0$ be the conversion rate in the control group (shown the old design).   \n",

    "\n",
    "The number of people (or user sessions) we decide to capture in each group will have an effect on the precision of our estimated conversion rates: **the larger the sample size**, the more precise our estimates (i.e. the smaller our confidence intervals), **the higher the chance to detect a difference** in the two groups, if present.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Type I Error Rate** ($\\alpha$) - The significance level we set earlier to 0.05.\n",
    "* **Type II Error rate** ($\\beta$) - In this case, we will choose a commonly used Type II error rate cutoff of $0.2$\n",
    "* **Power of the test** ($1 - \\beta$) - This represents the probability of finding a statistical difference between the groups in our test when a difference is actually present. In our case, the power is $1-0.2 = 0.8$,  (here's more info on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_a_test\">statistical power</a>, if you are curious)\n",
    "* **Effect size** - How big of a difference we expect there to be between the conversion rates.  Since our team would be happy with a difference of 2%, we can use 13% and 15% to calculate the effect size we expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having set the `power` parameter to 0.8 in practice means that if there exists an actual difference in conversion rate between our designs, assuming the difference is the one we estimated (13% vs. 15%), we have about 80% chance to detect it as statistically significant in our test with the sample size we calculated.\n",
