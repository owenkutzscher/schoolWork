PASSED TESTS, make sure our test is same as make rtest00 !!!!!!
make test01
make test02

need to do wait fg and do fg I think then everything else pretty easy






*** commands ***
unix> make
or
make rtest01
or
make test01

./shellAutograder.py


./tsh
*then run some test routines
^Z
[2]+ stopped // means job 2 stopped
fg %2 // bring to fg

& // bg

find / 
^lmaooo finds all the files in the whole thing.

OUTPUTS ARE ALWAYS IN THE FG EVEN IF ITS BG
AND CTRL C WONT STOP IT!!

if we run 
sleep 30 && cat && la && ......
^that whole thing is 1 job. Shell maintins it.
^^Inside this there are prosceses! (Job vs Proscess)

can run kill command on bg proscesses tho




make clean
make
./shellAutograder.py






*** refrence shell ***

./tshref
^run him

./myspin 300 &
^literally just spins and runs! Good for testing

fg %1
^puts job #1 into bg

bg %1

/bin/ps a
^list jobs idk
