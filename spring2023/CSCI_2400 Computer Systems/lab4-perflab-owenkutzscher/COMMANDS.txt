***COMMANDS***
make clean
make test
^will reset all the images if I mess them up


*** GENERAL CONCEPTS ***
* spacial locality:
    Cache will grab many elements at once so its easier to access say many elements of an array in a row if they are same position in memory

* temporal locality:
    If we grab an element and keep using it then it is in the cache and easy to grab

* Oflags
    Compiler does cool things













***CHANGES WE MADE OUTSIDE OF FilterMain.cpp***


 

***MakeFile

CXXFLAGS= -g -Ofast
*compiler is doing all the things it can to optimize

-fopenmp
*activates multithreading abilities for out pragma omp thing










***cs1300bmp.h

//
// Maximum image size
//
#define MAX_DIM 1025
^1024 is max size of an array!?!
*not sure about that, but having an array smaller makes it take less time to run. Less iterations
^^then use extra memory so cache isnt overwriting its self (it uses powers of 2) as much.


int -> short color[MAX_COLORS][MAX_DIM][MAX_DIM];
*short takes up less space than an int. Less memory to move and access
