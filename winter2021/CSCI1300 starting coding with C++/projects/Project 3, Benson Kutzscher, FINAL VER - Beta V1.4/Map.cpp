//the player is diplayed with some kind of character, a "P" for instance
//note the map is actually 15x27, so the function first finds where the player is and then
// outlines that specific section of map

    

    //first find the player and find out what "room" they're in
    //keep in mind the map in total has a size of 15 rows and 27 columns

    //then we will set the bounds on what to display

    //now just print the map with whatever room the player is in
    //we will use the bounds to display the map from the prevous if statements
